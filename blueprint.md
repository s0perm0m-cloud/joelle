# Human+ Application Blueprint

## Overview

Human+ is a web application that provides AI-powered career advice to individual users and helps enterprise users find the best candidates for their companies.

## Implemented Features

*   **Routing:** The application uses `react-router-dom` for routing. It has three routes: `/`, `/individual`, and `/enterprise`.
*   **Firebase Integration:** The application is integrated with Firebase for storing CVs and job descriptions.
*   **UI:** The application has a modern UI built with Tailwind CSS. It has a landing page, an individual user page, and an enterprise user page.
*   **UI Improvements:**
    *   **Landing Page:** Added a glassmorphism effect to the central content area to improve text readability over the background image.
    *   **Text Shadow:** Applied a text shadow to the heading and paragraph on the landing page to enhance contrast and legibility.

## Current Plan

I have improved the UI of the landing page for better readability. I will now wait for the next request.
